# Project Brief: SocialFlow AI

## Current Phase

**Phase 8**: Next.js Migration Planning - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: Frontend architecture complete and production-ready (Phase 7 complete). Next.js migration planning complete (Phase 8 planning). Ready to execute migration or proceed with backend planning.

**Development Philosophy**: 
- **SOLID/DRY Principles**: Guide all code development - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Dependency Inversion, Don't Repeat Yourself
- **No Backwards Compatibility**: Freedom to make breaking changes for better architecture - no legacy constraints
- **Refactor Without Fear**: Component getting complex? Split it. Better pattern emerges? Implement it immediately.

## Vision

Build an AI-first social media management platform that empowers individuals, teams, and agencies to create, schedule, and analyze content across multiple platforms with unprecedented efficiency and intelligence.

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Simplify Multi-Platform Management**: Provide a unified interface for managing content across 7+ social platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest)
2. **AI-Powered Content Creation**: Leverage Google Gemini to generate, optimize, and suggest content based on trends and user context
3. **Intelligent Scheduling**: Enable smart scheduling with calendar views, bulk operations, and automated posting
4. **Actionable Analytics**: Deliver insights that drive decision-making through engagement metrics, trend analysis, and performance tracking
5. **White-Label Solution**: Support agency use cases with customizable branding and multi-workspace capabilities

### Target Users

- **Individual Content Creators**: Freelancers and influencers managing personal brands
- **Social Media Managers**: Professionals managing brand presence across platforms
- **Marketing Teams**: Collaborative teams needing approval workflows and shared calendars
- **Agencies**: Multi-client organizations requiring white-label solutions and team management

## Key Features (In Scope)

### Content Management

- Multi-platform post composer with AI assistance
- Content calendar with drag-and-drop scheduling
- Media library with organization and templates
- Quick drafts and content reuse

### AI Capabilities

- Trending topics discovery and analysis
- AI-generated post suggestions
- Content optimization recommendations
- Sentiment analysis and crisis detection

### Platform Integration

- Social account connections and health monitoring
- Cross-platform posting
- Platform-specific options (Instagram first comment, Twitter threads, etc.)
- Link shortening and bio page management

### Analytics & Insights

- Engagement metrics and trend visualization
- Performance reports (exportable)
- Link click tracking
- Audience growth monitoring

### Collaboration & Workflow

- Team member management with roles
- Approval workflows
- Notifications and inbox for social interactions
- Command palette for power users

### Monetization Tiers

- **Free**: Basic features, limited AI credits, 1 workspace
- **Pro**: Advanced features, more AI credits, priority support
- **Agency**: White-label, unlimited workspaces, team management, API access

## Out of Scope (Current Phase)

- Native mobile applications (web-responsive only)
- Advanced video editing (basic trim/caption only)
- Direct social platform API integrations (using mock data)
- Real-time collaboration (concurrent editing)
- Built-in payment processing for e-commerce

## Success Criteria

### User Experience

- Onboarding completion rate > 80%
- User can schedule first post within 5 minutes
- AI suggestions adoption rate > 60%
- Platform connection success rate > 95%

### Performance

- Page load time < 2 seconds
- AI response time < 5 seconds
- Calendar rendering for 100+ posts < 1 second

### Business

- User retention rate > 70% after 30 days
- Upgrade conversion from Free to Pro > 15%
- Agency tier adoption by qualifying users > 25%

## Technical Constraints

- Modern browser support only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)
- Google Gemini API dependency for AI features
- Client-side state management (no global state library initially)
- Progressive enhancement approach (graceful degradation)

## Project Boundaries

### Phase 7 (Complete) - Code Quality & Cleanup

**Status**: ✅ Complete (November 23, 2025)

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ ESLint/Prettier/Vitest infrastructure configured
- ✅ Legacy code removed (16 files)
- ✅ Zero linting errors achieved (53 → 0)
- ✅ 100% TypeScript type safety (all `any` types eliminated)
- ✅ Professional code organization with path aliases

**Strategic Decision**: Comprehensive testing deferred to Phase 10 (after backend integration) to avoid test rewrites during architectural changes. Current clean, well-organized code with zero errors provides adequate confidence for MVP development.

### Phase 8 (Complete) - Next.js Migration Planning

**Status**: ✅ Complete (November 23, 2025)

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive migration implementation plan
- ✅ Documented 10 detailed phases (8a-8j) with step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Each phase includes testing, troubleshooting, and rollback strategies
- ✅ Estimated execution time: 8-12 hours (Phase 8h optional)
- ✅ Zero breaking changes expected - all 135+ components preserved
- ✅ Migration approach: Incremental, testable, SPA mode initially

**Deliverables**:
- `implementation_plan.md`: Complete technical overview
- `docs/phases/phase8a-8j_*.md`: 10 phase documentation files

**Next Options**:
1. Execute migration (8-12 hours) - Recommended first
2. Backend planning (database, API, auth, infrastructure)

### Phase 8 Implementation (Future - Optional) - Execute Next.js Migration

**Status**: 🔵 Planned (ready to execute when needed)

**Goals**:
- Execute phases 8a-8g sequentially (required phases)
- Optionally execute phase 8h (router migration - can defer)
- Execute phases 8i-8j (build, test, deployment prep)
- Migrate from Vite to Next.js 16 with zero breaking changes
- Deploy to Vercel

**Timeline**: 8-12 hours execution time

### Phase 9 (Future) - Backend Planning & Development

- Real social platform integrations
- Backend API and data persistence
- User authentication system
- Advanced automation workflows
- Team collaboration features

### Phase 10 (Future) - Integration, Testing & Polish

- Connect frontend to backend API
- Replace mock data with real data
- **Write comprehensive test suite** (deferred from Phase 7)
- Implement real social platform integrations
- Add real-time features
- Performance optimization

### Phase 11 (Future) - Scale & Enhance

- Mobile native apps
- Advanced video editing
- Marketplace for templates/content
- Third-party integrations (Zapier, etc.)
- AI model customization

## Design Philosophy

1. **AI-First**: Every workflow should have an intelligent assistant component
2. **Simplicity**: Complex features should feel simple; reduce cognitive load
3. **Speed**: Interactions should feel instant; no unnecessary loading states
4. **Flexibility**: Power users get shortcuts and advanced options without cluttering basic UI
5. **Beauty**: Professional, modern design that scales from light to dark themes

## Current Architecture Status

**Lines of Code**: 6,897 → 1,300 lines in main files (-81% reduction)
**Components**: 135+ focused, testable components across 9 features
**Custom Hooks**: 5 reusable + 9 feature-specific hooks
**UI Library**: 4 reusable primitives (Button, Input, Modal, Card)
**TypeScript**: 0 compilation errors
**Testing**: Infrastructure ready, tests to be written in Phase 7
